# HTML Headings

Welcome to the HTML Headings tutorial on `codeswithpankaj.com`. In this tutorial, we will explore what HTML headings are, why they are important, and provide examples to help you understand how to use them effectively.

### What are HTML Headings?

HTML headings are used to define the titles and subtitles of your web content. They range from `<h1>` to `<h6>`, with `<h1>` being the most important (or top-level heading) and `<h6>` being the least important.

### Importance of HTML Headings

1. **Structure and Organization:** Headings help to structure and organize your content, making it easier for users to read and understand.
2. **SEO (Search Engine Optimization):** Search engines use headings to understand the hierarchy and relevance of your content, which can affect your page's ranking.
3. **Accessibility:** Properly used headings improve the accessibility of your web pages for screen readers and other assistive technologies.

### HTML Heading Elements

#### `<h1>`: Main Heading

The `<h1>` element represents the main heading of a web page or section.

**Example:**

```html
<h1>Welcome to codeswithpankaj.com</h1>
```

#### `<h2>`: Subheading

The `<h2>` element represents a subheading, used to define sections under the main heading.

**Example:**

```html
<h1>Welcome to codeswithpankaj.com</h1>
<h2>Learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</h2>
```

#### `<h3>`: Sub-subheading

The `<h3>` element is used for further subsections under `<h2>` headings.

**Example:**

```html
<h1>Welcome to codeswithpankaj.com</h1>
<h2>Learn HTML</h2>
<h3>Introduction to HTML</h3>
```

#### `<h4>`: Lower-level Heading

The `<h4>` element is used for headings under `<h3>`.

**Example:**

```html
<h1>Welcome to codeswithpankaj.com</h1>
<h2>Learn HTML</h2>
<h3>Introduction to HTML</h3>
<h4>HTML Elements</h4>
```

#### `<h5>` and `<h6>`: Even Lower-level Headings

The `<h5>` and `<h6>` elements are used for even lower levels of headings, rarely used but available for complex documents.

**Example:**

```html
<h1>Welcome to codeswithpankaj.com</h1>
<h2>Learn HTML</h2>
<h3>Introduction to HTML</h3>
<h4>HTML Elements</h4>
<h5>Basic Elements</h5>
<h6>Element Examples</h6>
```
