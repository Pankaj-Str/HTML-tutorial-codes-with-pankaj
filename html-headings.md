#### **Step-by-Step Guide to HTML Headings**

**1. What Are HTML Headings?**

Headings in HTML are used to define the titles and subtitles of sections on a webpage. They help organize the content and create a structure that is easy to navigate. Headings range from `<h1>` to `<h6>`, with `<h1>` being the highest (or most important) level and `<h6>` being the lowest.

**2. Types of HTML Headings**

HTML provides six levels of headings:

* `<h1>`: Main heading, used for the most important title or section.
* `<h2>`: Subheading, typically used for subsections under the main heading.
* `<h3>`: Further division of content within an `<h2>` section.
* `<h4>`, `<h5>`, and `<h6>`: Used for even more granular divisions, representing smaller, less important sections of content.

**3. Use of Headings**

Headings serve two main purposes:

* **Content Organization**: They break content into logical sections, making it easier for users to scan and find relevant information.
* **SEO (Search Engine Optimization)**: Headings help search engines understand the structure and importance of the content. Search engines give more weight to `<h1>` and `<h2>` tags when indexing web pages.

**4. Explanation of Each Heading Tag with Example**

1.  **`<h1>`: Main Heading** This is the most important heading on a web page. Itâ€™s usually used for the title of the entire page or a main section.

    ```html
    <h1>This is an H1 Heading</h1>
    ```
2.  **`<h2>`: Subheading** `<h2>` is typically used for subheadings or major sections under the main title.

    ```html
    <h2>This is an H2 Heading</h2>
    ```
3.  **`<h3>`: Sub-subheading** This heading tag is used for sub-sections of the `<h2>` section.

    ```html
    <h3>This is an H3 Heading</h3>
    ```
4.  **`<h4>`: Smaller Heading** `<h4>` is used for even smaller subsections within an `<h3>` heading.

    ```html
    <h4>This is an H4 Heading</h4>
    ```
5.  **`<h5>`: Small Heading** You can use this for more detailed subsections within an `<h4>` heading.

    ```html
    <h5>This is an H5 Heading</h5>
    ```
6.  **`<h6>`: Smallest Heading** The `<h6>` tag is the smallest heading tag and is used for very minor headings or for minor detail sections.

    ```html
    <h6>This is an H6 Heading</h6>
    ```

**5. Example of All Headings Together**

Below is an example that uses all six heading tags in a structured manner:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>HTML Headings Example</title>
</head>
<body>

    <h1>Main Title of the Page (H1)</h1>
    <h2>First Section (H2)</h2>
    <h3>Subsection of First Section (H3)</h3>
    <h4>Details of Subsection (H4)</h4>
    <h5>Additional Details (H5)</h5>
    <h6>Smallest Heading for Minor Info (H6)</h6>

</body>
</html>
```

***

**6. When to Use Which Heading**

* **`<h1>`**: Only one `<h1>` should be used per page, as it defines the primary purpose or title.
* **`<h2>`**: Use for major sections or categories on the page.
* **`<h3>`**: For subsections or subtopics within a section.
* **`<h4>`, `<h5>`, `<h6>`**: For smaller sections, finer details, or additional notes under higher-level headings.
