#### HTML Paragraph Tags Tutorial

**Tutorial by: Codes with Pankaj**

HTML paragraph tags are used to define blocks of text or paragraphs within web pages. These tags play a key role in organizing textual content for better readability and structure.

***

#### **Explanation of All HTML Paragraph Tags**

**1. `<p>`: The Basic Paragraph Tag**

The most common tag used for paragraphs in HTML is the `<p>` tag. It defines a block of text as a paragraph. Browsers automatically add some margin before and after the text inside `<p>` tags to make the content easier to read.

**Example:**

```html
<p>This is a simple paragraph in HTML.</p>
```

**2. Line Breaks within Paragraphs: `<br>` Tag**

The `<br>` tag is used to insert a line break within a paragraph without starting a new one. It is a self-closing tag and doesnâ€™t require an end tag.

**Example:**

```html
<p>This is a paragraph. <br> This sentence will appear on the next line within the same paragraph.</p>
```

***

**3. Preformatted Text: `<pre>` Tag**

The `<pre>` tag preserves the formatting of the text inside it, such as spaces and line breaks. Unlike normal HTML paragraphs, the `<pre>` tag does not collapse multiple spaces or line breaks.

**Example:**

```html
<pre>
This is preformatted text.
   It keeps all spaces and
line breaks as you see here.
</pre>
```

***

**4. The `align` Attribute (Deprecated)**

Earlier versions of HTML allowed you to align paragraph text using the `align` attribute (with values such as `left`, `right`, `center`, or `justify`). However, this attribute has been deprecated in favor of using CSS for alignment.

**Example (deprecated):**

```html
<p align="center">This paragraph is centered.</p>
```

**Note**: Use CSS instead for modern alignment practices.

***

**5. Multiple Paragraphs**

You can create multiple paragraphs by using multiple `<p>` tags. Each new `<p>` tag creates a distinct paragraph with its own block of text.

**Example:**

```html
<p>This is the first paragraph.</p>
<p>This is the second paragraph, separate from the first one.</p>
```

***

#### **Summary of Paragraph Tags**

* **`<p>`**: Defines a paragraph.
* **`<br>`**: Inserts a line break within a paragraph.
* **`<pre>`**: Preserves text formatting, including spaces and line breaks.
* **Deprecated**: The `align` attribute (use CSS instead for text alignment).
